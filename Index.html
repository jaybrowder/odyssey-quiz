    <h1>Odyssey the Otter's Ancient Adventure</h1>
    <div class="story">
        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>Deep in the heart of the ancient Appalachian Mountains lived Odyssey, a curious blue-furred otter with a pair of cool sunglasses. These mountains were no ordinary peaks - they were a staggering 1.2 billion years old! Can you imagine the stories the ancient rocks could tell if they could talk? They held secrets going back over a billion years.</p>
        <p>Odyssey's den was nestled along the banks of a crystal clear river, with multiple entrances above and below the waterline, tucked under the roots of a mighty oak tree. The river flowed over rocks called gneiss (pronounced "nice"), a metamorphic rock formed by extreme heat and pressure, composed mostly of the minerals quartz and feldspar. Odyssey loved the way the gneiss glistened in the sunlight when he went for a swim.</p>
        <p>He and his otter pals loved swimming in the fresh, clean water that flowed from the heart of these primordial mountains. The mountains themselves were made up of metamorphic rocks like gneiss and another called schist (pronounced "shist"). Schist contained lots of flat mica minerals that made the rock look sparkly.</p>
        <p>One sunny morning, Odyssey emerged from his den, donned his favorite sunglasses, and called to his friends. "Who's up for an adventure today? I want to explore the Blue Ridge Escarpment!" The Blue Ridge Escarpment was a towering mountain wall, known to the Cherokee as the Blue Wall, that rose over 3,000 feet from its base. Though much younger than the ancient Appalachians at 200 million years old, it was still old enough to hold many secrets.</p>
        <p>The otters excitedly made their way upstream, playing and frolicking in the currents. They slid down natural water slides formed by smooth schist rock faces and plunged into deep pools, looking for tasty fish, crayfish, and freshwater clams to snack on. The water was so pure and clear that Odyssey could easily spot his next meal with his otter vision.</p>
        <p>As they rested on the warm, metamorphic gneiss rocks along the riverbank, Odyssey recalled what his teacher Mr. Cedro had said about their formation. "These rocks were once ancient ocean sediments and molten rocks from deep in the Earth's crust. But over billions of years, intense heat and pressure transformed them into gneiss and schist during periods of severe continental collision when the Appalachians were forming."</p>
        <p>Finally, they arrived at the base of the towering Blue Ridge Escarpment. Odyssey marveled at the exposed rock layers showing over a billion years of geological history. He recalled what he had learned - this incredible rock wall was formed during the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea eons ago when the eastern North American continent pulled away from North Africa. He wondered what it would have been like to witness such an event!</p>
        <p>"Last one to the top is a rotten fish!" Odyssey exclaimed with a mischievous grin...</p>
